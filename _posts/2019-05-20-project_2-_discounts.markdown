Aarghh i am not a fan of SQL. I understand that it is the basis of how most companies store their data, but i find its syntax to be boring and basic. Everytime i sit to write an SQL syntax, i feel like i am stepping into a time capsule and going back to the 60's to program. No offense to the 60's.

Anyway for this second project, i had to utilize my SQL skills to fetch different data points for two different tables. The concept of keys and join statements while interesting can also prove to be a hassle. Anyway after i managed to create my dataframe, thanks in no small part to my tutor and stackoverflow.,It was pretty straight forward after that. 
I must confess i had to revisit my statistics material to referesh on the concept of sample distributions and distribution means.

From then on verifying my hypothesis was a matter of utilizing and interpreting the p-values from t-test and the implementation of tukey tests to determine if there was significant difference amongst multiple groups.

This project opened my eyes to the speed at which statistical analysis can be used to support business decisions. While not completely error proof it can be used to confirm intuitions or discard biases.

My findings from the project can be summarized as follows:

Discounts do affect sales and should be used selectively
Employee training was necessary to boost sales
Equally stock products in all regions.
Express shipping offered us (the company) the best bang for our buck
