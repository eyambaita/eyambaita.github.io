We all seem to think we are unique. we see this type of thinking in every facet of life. Each newborn is celebrated when they first take a step as though they have discovered penicillin or when the utter the words Mama as though they are the first to do that.

Our step by step journey through life is also viewed as a unique experience, but is it really though? From the perspective of the individual every expereince they have seems unique to them afterall that is by the very definitiion of being an individual. However if you correct for behavioural outliers in the human race, couldnt the assumption be made that the human experience is shockingly similar. Afterall the breadth of emotions we experience are all the same and our daily personal goals seem to revolve around maximizing the emotions we like and minimizing the ones we dislike. So in essence we are all trying to solving the same optimization problem. Now we might have differences  in the thresholds for how we want to maximize pleasure or minimize pain but ultimately we are moving along the same curve.

More evidence of our similiarity is reflected in the way we rate, rank and review services online. We all seem to optimize around the same parameters. We all like the sensation of getting a "bargain". No one walks away from a bargain, no one likes to pay for something after the pleasure of the experience is exhausted or finally the strength of the groupthink mentality when a large number of people rank something one way.

These behaviors were evident in my analysis of a popular short term home rentals site data where i saw that the most important features to the review scores that customers were giving were the rental price, cleaning fee and the previous rating given the to rental owner.

This leads me to believe that a large swat of the rental population seems to care about the same thing and so tweaking of a few features by a rental owner can drastically impact the number of customers (bookings) that they receive. All other  perks besides basic amenities can easily be ignored as they only seem to increase to the rental owners cost, with no significant experiencial benefit.

As a renter myself i am quite fascinated at how easily i can be nudged...at least the data says so!
