For my final project i decided to do something a bit more ambitious. I decided to link up to twitter and fetch some tweets and do a sentment analysis. Considering where i started from 10 months ago, i chuckled to myself at the level of ambition i had. Anyway once i set out, it didnt seem all too difficult at all. Linking up to twitter was pretty straight forward, fetching the news feeds from some of the top papers in the world, cleaning up the data, running the analysis and visualizing the result went pretty well. Once i was done i decided to add a layer on top of a simplified AI assistant who i called Jarvis and with a few lines of code, Jarvis could ask me if i wanted to read the news, what channel i wanted and if i wanted positively skewed news or was indifferent. To think i could do this in a couple of days makes me wonder what a dedicated team of datascientists and engineers with resources from a "Stark-like"organization could build.  The concept of a more intelligent Jarvis doesnt seem to far fetched afterall.
