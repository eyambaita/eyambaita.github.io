I like how the term datascienctist has become a buzz word, but who is really a datascientist? I find that the current definition is somewhat nuanced. Is the primary skill of a datascientist the ability to crunch large sets of data to reveal actionable information?  if yes well how does that differ from a statistician. If the primary ability is to write cool software code to manipulate the data set, well where has the mathematician, computer scientist and engineer gone who could do that with previous software applications.

I find that this new label can be a bit misleading. I do not necessarily believe that anything new has been invented, i just find that the tools have gotten more efficient and we have learned to stack more and more simple concepts on top each other to create new complex ones. This ultimately improves and increases our efficiency.  When the crane was invented it made the builder more efficient, but didnt decrease his value in the search for a crane operator

Think of the KNN algorithm at its core that uses a simple philosophy of ordering and clustering that people have used for ages.  We use it to determine peoples value (eg where did you go to college? Harvard. wow you must be a genius. What part of town did you grow up in? Oh wow, you must be a saint). 

To keep this short, while i do appreciate the use of a new term to describe a skill, i think it is a good idea to pause and ask what exactly is the competence we are looking for and can't it be found in the previous "labels" that existed to date. 
In addition i think we should see datascience as an additonal course that should become a standard in STEM education.  i think it should be approached as an icing on the cake. it makes the cake pop and wow, but for the cake, you need more analytical, standard and traditional experience.
