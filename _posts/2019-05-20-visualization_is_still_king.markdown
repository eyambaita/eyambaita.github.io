Why are movies still so popular?  Why do we watch videos all day long on our phones? How do babies learn? While leaning i think requires all the senses we have, i still think "visualization" or more crudely "watching" or "staring at" is the quickest way we learn.

I mean think about it, how many people can rattle of the family trees of the hit show game of thrones, put that same story on a paper and greater than 80% of the shows fan would consider it boring a tenth of the way through. I believe that viewing things is the easiest  way of learning or processing information.

When processing large chunks of data, evaluaing it on a spreadsheet can provide little insight, but put that on an x-y plot and bam! some form of trend  might start to surface. Reconfigure that into a histogram, bar plot or pie chart and even more information might start to be visible about the data set.

I find this to be interesting because even before you apply any fancy algorithm to determine detailed nuances, the human mind can quickly make out trends and identify outliers and influencers.

My favourite plot still remains the humble x-y plot. Its basic in its nature and is most times the most humble indicator of what you might be dealing with. It helps to set your gut in one direction. The other fancier algorithms serve to either say stay the course or pause and revaluate.

In conclusion never underestimate the simplicity of a visual illustration.
