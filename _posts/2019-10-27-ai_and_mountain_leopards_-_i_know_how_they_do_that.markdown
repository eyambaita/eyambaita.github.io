My datascience journey has been quite the tale. I have had periods when i wondered just how much i had learnt in the last year of coding and  theoretical reading.
Then it happened, I saw an ad on tv while the sunday night football game was on pause. it was Microsoft's ad about how AI could be used to track the movement of mountain leopards in an area and how that information could be used to help in the preservation efforts of that specie.
I remember yelling, Jeez! I know how they do that. I understood how the process worked from the process of data collection via cameras setup in the wild, to how a model would be created that would be trained on millions of images of mountain leopards and how a neural network could be set up and tuned to classify all the captured images.
I understood how easy and fast a task like that would be and i was like wow! I guess i did learn something afterall.
