Wow I am thankful for the developers who put together the base plugins for neural networks in Anaconda.  It is amazing the complex evalautions one can perform using just a few lines of code.  It seems to me now that the biggest tasks to perform evalautions using NN would be the cleaning of the data, tweaking of the model features like number of layers, activation functions, loss functions and ultimately the evaluation of the result to verify that it matches real world observations.

I personally had expected it to be a bit more than it actually is and i know that these can scale to be much more complex but again thanks to the developers who continue to build amazing libraries from where you can call off methods to use in your model and this helps you focus on what actually matters, the recommendation from the model.
